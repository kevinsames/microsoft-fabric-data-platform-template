# 08. Cross-cutting Concepts

Several cross-cutting concerns are addressed, ensuring that non-functional requirements (like security, logging, and maintainability) are systematically handled:

- **Security & Access Control:**
  - *Secret Management:* No credentials are hard-coded. Azure credentials for Terraform and Databricks tokens for CLI are stored as GitHub Secrets. Within Databricks, secrets (like the ADLS service principal key) are stored in a Databricks Secret Scope (backed by Azure Key Vault or Databricks-managed). Code and notebooks retrieve secrets at runtime via Databricks utilities (e.g., `dbutils.secrets.get()`), so passwords/keys are never exposed in plain text. Unity Catalog (if enabled) further secures data access at the table/column level.
  - *Permissions:* Each environment can have separate access permissions. For example, development workspace might allow more users, while production is restricted. Unity Catalog can enforce fine-grained access, and code follows least privilege principles.
  - *Compliance:* Versioning of code and infrastructure in Git and logging of model metadata in MLflow contribute to auditability. Unity Catalog also captures lineage and audit logs for queries and data access, supporting compliance.

- **Data Management and Quality:**
  - *Data Lake Organization:* Organizing the data lake in layers (coal, bronze, silver, gold) and encourages using Delta Lake format for processed data for ACID transactions and schema enforcement.
  - *Data Validation:* Checks should be integrated for data quality and contract enforcement. Data validation in the pipeline ensures upstream changes or corrupt data are caught early. The concept of data contracts—formal expectations on data schema and semantics—is highlighted and enforced.

- **Logging & Monitoring:**
  - *Application Logging:* Notebooks and Python modules use standard logging. Databricks captures these logs, viewable in job output. Cluster log delivery to ADLS can be enabled for persistent logging.
  - *MLflow Tracking:* MLflow logs each run’s details, providing experiment telemetry and traceability for models, parameters, and metrics.
  - *Error Handling:* Code is written to handle errors gracefully, logging clear messages and failing jobs when necessary. CI tests ensure error paths are tested. Databricks job configs can specify retries.
  - *Performance Monitoring:* Spark metrics are accessible in the UI, and additional monitoring can be integrated if needed. Automated jobs and version control allow tracking performance regressions.

- **Scalability & Resilience:**
  - *Scalability:* Spark enables vertical and horizontal scaling by configuration. Cluster specs can be adjusted in job configs, and autoscaling is supported.
  - *Resilience:* Delta Lake provides fault tolerance. Checkpoints and retries can be built into pipelines. The infrastructure is cloud-managed for high availability.

- **Extensibility & Modularity:**
  - Teams can add streaming jobs, real-time serving, or new pipeline stages as needed. The modular design allows replacing or adding components (e.g., integrating Azure ML or Databricks DLT pipelines).

- **Build and Release Management:**
  - Each build is traceable to a Git commit. Tagging releases allows tracking and rollback. Branching and PR templates foster a DevOps culture.

- **Usability and Developer Experience:**
  - The README provides step-by-step instructions and example data for a quick start. Environment setup is documented, and dev containers or Dockerfiles can be included for consistency. arc42 docs in `/docs` serve as developer documentation.

- **Cross-Team Collaboration:**
  - Everything is in Git, improving collaboration. Databricks Repos can sync with GitHub for collaborative notebook development. Contributing guidelines and issue templates foster a community approach.

In summary, cross-cutting concerns of security, data quality, logging, performance, and collaboration are built into the design, ensuring these aspects are consistently handled in any project derived from it.
