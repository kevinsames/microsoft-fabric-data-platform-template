# 04. Solution Strategy

To meet the goals and constraints, the repository adopts a solution strategy based on modular development, and continuous integration/deployment:

- **Databricks Asset Bundles for Workspaces:**  
  Application-level resources on Databricks (notebooks, jobs, clusters, MLflow experiment configs, etc.) are managed through Databricks Asset Bundles. Asset Bundles allow us to describe these assets declaratively (in YAML and through code) and deploy them as a single package to the workspace. The repository includes a bundle configuration (e.g., `bundle.yaml`) that lists notebooks to deploy, job definitions (with schedules, clusters, parameters), and other workspace objects. Using bundles means that a new environment or update can be deployed with one CLI command (`databricks bundle deploy`), ensuring the notebooks and jobs in the workspace always match the git version. This facilitates adopting software engineering best practices on Databricks by treating notebooks and job configs as versioned code rather than manual UI objects.

- **Modular Code with Notebooks Integration:**  
  We follow a hybrid development style: core logic is implemented in reusable Python modules (under `/src`), while notebooks in serve as orchestration or interactive analysis tools. The strategy is to allow data scientists to use notebooks for exploration and pipeline assembly, but keep complex logic (data transformations, model definitions, etc.) in testable Python functions. Notebooks can import the Python package from `/src` (e.g., via `%pip install -e .` during development or by using Databricks Repos which automatically load the repo code). This yields the best of both worlds – interactivity and easy debugging in notebooks, plus maintainable, unit-tested code in modules. An example included is a training notebook that calls functions from the project’s Python package to perform data prep and model training, then logs results with MLflow.

- **Continuous Integration (Linting & Testing):**  
  The repository uses GitHub Actions to automate quality checks on every push/PR. A linting job (with tools like flake8, black, isort) ensures code style consistency. A test job uses pytest to run all tests in, including any Spark job tests (possibly using a local Spark or Databricks Connect for integration tests). Notebooks can be validated (for example, with a custom script or nbconvert to check for syntax errors). By enforcing that the CI passes (all tests green, no lint errors) before merging, we maintain a high code quality bar.

- **Continuous Deployment (GitHub Actions):**  
  Deployment to Databricks is automated. Upon merging to the main branch (or when a release is cut), a GitHub Actions workflow will:
  - Use the Databricks CLI to deploy the asset bundle to the target workspace. This involves authenticating to Databricks (using a PAT token or service principal credentials stored in GitHub Secrets) and running `databricks bundle deploy` which uploads notebooks, config, and updates job definitions. Because the bundle defines jobs, any changes to job schedules or cluster sizes are applied through this process.

- **Multi-Environment Strategy:**  
  The solution supports dev → prod promotion. Each environment can correspond to a separate Databricks workspace and separate cloud resources (storage, etc.). The Asset Bundle config can have environment-specific sections or one can maintain separate bundle config files per environment. Promotion of code is handled via Git tagging: e.g., tag a branch and then run deployment to the prod workspace; merging into main triggers development integration. This approach ensures that the same code that was tested in development is what gets deployed in production, satisfying the enterprise need for controlled releases. (The included documentation describes how to configure these environment promotions.)

- **Integration of MLflow:**  
  The project leverages Databricks-managed MLflow for tracking experiments and models. During training runs, the code uses MLflow APIs (or autologging) to log parameters, metrics, and model artifacts. Because MLflow is built-in, it requires no extra infrastructure – but we treat the tracking URI and experiment IDs as configuration (the bundle can, for instance, define an MLflow Experiment to use). By integrating MLflow tracking and model registry, the template ensures any model produced can be traced, compared, and properly versioned. Databricks’ MLflow is robust and scalable for enterprise use, so it fits the enterprise-grade requirement. In practice, a training job notebook will end by registering a model in MLflow (in staging mode), which an engineer can promote to prod in the Model Registry when appropriate.

- **Governance and Data Security:**  
  The solution integrates Unity Catalog for data governance. Unity Catalog, provides centralized governance for data and AI assets. With Unity Catalog, data access in notebooks use Unity Catalog’s managed tables or external locations instead of ad-hoc mounts. However, including it demonstrates how to enforce fine-grained access control, track data lineage, and implement data contracts (agreements on schema) in an enterprise setting. Data contracts, in particular, are encouraged as part of pipeline design – they formalize the schema and data expectations between producers and consumers. For instance, the project can include JSON schema definitions or use a tool like Great Expectations to validate incoming data schema, catching upstream changes early.

- **Documentation and Dev UX:**  
  Recognizing that data scientists value a quick start and clear guidance, the template includes a rich set of documentation in the `/docs` folder, following the arc42 architecture framework. This ensures that anyone using the template can understand the architectural rationale and how to adapt it. Additionally, a `README.md` at the project root provides a quick start guide for running the Terraform, setting up Databricks CLI authentication, and executing the example pipelines (like training on the included sample dataset). By generating docs (e.g., via MkDocs or Sphinx), teams can also publish internal documentation sites for their project derived from this template.

Overall, the strategy is to treat most as code – data pipelines, configurations – and use automation to tie them together. This reduces the “works on my machine” syndrome and manual steps, creating a seamless path from development to production for workflows.
