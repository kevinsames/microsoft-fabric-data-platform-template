# 01. Introduction and Goals

This GitHub repository is designed for **enterprise-grade BI/ML workflows on Azure Databricks**, targeting data scientists/engineers who need a robust, production-ready Data/ML-Ops foundation.

## Key Objectives

- **Reproducibility & Automation:**  
  Everything from infrastructure to notebooks is defined as code (Infrastructure-as-Code, pipeline definitions, etc.) to enable full automation and consistent reproducibility across environments. This aligns with a high MLOps maturity (LevelÂ 4), emphasizing full automation, continuous monitoring, and robust collaboration. All changes are promoted through code (not manual UI tweaks) to ensure traceability and repeatability.

- **Collaboration & Quality:**  
  Facilitate teamwork via Git and pull requests. Data scientists can iteratively develop in notebooks or Python modules with code review, while automated CI pipelines run linting, tests, and notebook checks to ensure only tested, high-quality code is merged. The repo's CI/CD ensures that only tested code is deployed to production, gating releases through automation.

- **Scalability & Performance:**  
  Leverage Azure Databricks (Spark clusters) for scalable data processing and model training. The solution uses PySpark for big data and integrates with Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS Gen2) for virtually unlimited data scaling. Clusters can be configured to autoscale and use optimized runtimes for performance.

- **Governance & Traceability:**  
  Integrate MLflow for experiment tracking and model registry, and Unity Catalog for data governance. Databricks provides a managed MLflow service to track models, parameters, and metrics in a robust, enterprise-scalable way. Unity Catalog integration offers centralized access control and lineage tracking across workspaces, supporting compliance and audit requirements.

- **Maintainability & Extensibility:**  
  Enforce clean code practices (via formatting and lint checks, modular `/src` code) and include comprehensive documentation (architectural docs, user guides). The repository structure separates concerns (infrastructure vs. code vs. notebooks) to make it easy to extend or modify parts of the solution. It is intended as a cookie-cutter or GitHub Template repository that teams can easily fork and customize for their specific projects.

## Stakeholders and Expectations

The primary users are **Data Scientists** (expecting easy experimentation, data access, and tracking), supported by **ML Engineers/DevOps** (expecting automation, testing, and easy deployment) and **Data Platform Administrators** (expecting governance, security, and compliance features).
