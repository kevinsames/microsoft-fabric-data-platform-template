# 10. Quality Requirements

The template is built to meet high quality standards expected in production BI/ML systems. Below we summarize key quality attributes and how the design satisfies them:

- **Reliability:**  
  The workflow is resilient to failures. Automated retries can be configured for jobs in case of transient failures. The use of Delta Lake ensures that data pipeline steps (like writes) are ACID, preventing corruption on errors. CI tests catch bugs before deployment, reducing runtime errors. The infrastructure is managed (Databricks SLA for uptime), and we avoid single points of failure by using cloud services (no custom server that could go down).

- **Scalability:**  
  Both data processing and model training scale with data size by virtue of using Spark on Databricks. If data or user load increases, one can scale out by using larger clusters or parallel jobs. The design does not hard-code any limits (it works on small sample in dev and can work on large data in prod by configuration). The modular code allows swapping in more optimized algorithms if needed (e.g., using Spark MLlib for distributed ML if single-node sklearn doesn’t scale for a particular use-case).

- **Maintainability:**  
  The separation of concerns (infra, code, notebooks, tests) and adherence to standards makes the project maintainable. New team members can read the documentation (arc42 docs and code comments) to understand the system. The presence of tests means refactoring can be done with confidence. The consistent code style (enforced by lint/format) keeps the codebase clean as it grows. Issues and PR templates facilitate structured improvement.

- **Reproducibility & Reusability:**  
  Everything from environment setup to model training is reproducible via code and configuration. Rerunning Terraform and redeploying the bundle yields the same setup. Model training runs are reproducible—given the same code version, input data, and random seeds, one should get the same model (assuming determinism in ML libraries). MLflow logs data versions and parameters to help here. The repository itself is reusable for new projects; one can use it as a template and just replace the domain-specific parts.

- **Efficiency (Performance):**  
  The solution leverages Spark’s parallelism for heavy tasks, and uses vectorized operations in pandas for single-node operations. The CI pipeline caches dependencies where possible to speed up builds. Unnecessary overhead in pipelines is avoided (e.g., not running full integration tests on every small commit). Scheduled jobs allocate compute only when needed, optimizing resource usage and cost.

- **Security:**  
  Security best practices are followed (no credentials in code, least-privilege roles, secure communications). This reduces risk of data leaks or unauthorized access, which is crucial for enterprise trust in the pipeline.

- **Interoperability:**  
  Output models and data are in standard formats (Delta tables, Parquet, MLflow Model format). Other tools can easily use them. Registered MLflow models can be loaded by Azure ML or Python scripts outside Databricks. Data in ADLS can be read by other Azure services, enabling integration into broader data ecosystems. Unity Catalog ensures data and models can be shared across different Databricks workspaces or platforms with governance.

- **User Experience:**  
  For data scientists, using this template should feel enabling, not restrictive. They work with notebooks and familiar libraries, but with guardrails. Example notebooks and clear instructions reduce the learning curve. Well-documented notebooks aid knowledge sharing. The README serves as a user guide to running experiments and adding new components.

- **Monitoring & Feedback:**  
  The design includes monitoring of model performance over time (via MLflow experiments). CI/CD provides immediate feedback on code quality. For model quality in production, optional monitoring for data drift or scoring service uptime can be added. The pipeline itself can become a source of feedback if instrumented properly.

- **Evolution (Flexibility):**  
  The architecture is flexible to evolve as business requirements change. New datasets, online model serving, or new pipeline stages can be added without redoing everything. Modular design and widely adopted tools ensure easy extension or modification. Architecture documentation helps future changes be made with understanding and clarity.

To sum up, this template strives to provide an architecture that scores high on important quality attributes for enterprise ML systems. By using proven technologies and best practices, it aims to give enterprises confidence that workflows built from this template will be robust, scalable, and maintainable in the long run.
