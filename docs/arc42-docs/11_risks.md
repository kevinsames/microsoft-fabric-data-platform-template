# 11. Risks and Technical Debt

No project is without risks or technical debt. Here we outline potential risks, challenges, and areas of technical debt in the template, along with mitigation strategies:

- **Complexity for New Users:**  
  The comprehensive nature of the template (Terraform, GitHub Actions, Asset Bundles, etc.) might overwhelm data scientists unfamiliar with DevOps tools. *Mitigation:* Extensive documentation and onboarding tutorials are provided. The setup is modular, allowing gradual adoption. At least one team member should be comfortable with Terraform/CI to assist others.

- **Cloud Cost Overruns:**  
  Misconfigured Spark clusters or excessive storage/egress can drive up costs. *Mitigation:* Sensible defaults (auto-termination, spot instances), cluster policies, and scheduled jobs are used. Teams are encouraged to monitor usage with Azure Cost Management and Databricks cost reports.

- **Data Quality Issues (Data Schema Evolution):**  
  Upstream data changes can break pipelines or cause silent errors. *Mitigation:* Enforce data contracts and schema checks in pipelines. Integrate tools like Great Expectations. Update contracts and tests when upstream changes are planned.

- **Model Performance Degradation:**  
  Models may degrade over time due to data or concept drift. *Mitigation:* Encourage periodic retraining and metric review in MLflow. Suggest adding drift monitoring steps as a future enhancement.

- **CI Pipeline Speed (Technical Debt):**  
  Integration tests, especially those running on clusters, can slow CI. *Mitigation:* Keep default CI fast with local tests; run full notebook tests nightly or on-demand. Use caching in GitHub Actions. Separate quick checks from full integration tests as the project grows.

- **Maintaining Dependencies (Technical Debt):**  
  Pinned library versions may become outdated. Databricks runtime versions also change. *Mitigation:* Update dependencies periodically and test thoroughly. Use Dependabot or similar tools for alerts, but always validate upgrades with tests.

- **Multi-tenancy and Collaboration:**  
  Multiple projects in one workspace can cause naming/resource collisions. *Mitigation:* Prefix resource names with project name, use Unity Catalog for namespacing, or deploy separate workspaces for each project.

- **Documentation Lagging Implementation (Technical Debt):**  
  Docs can become outdated as code changes. *Mitigation:* Treat docs as part of the code—require updates in PRs. Automate doc generation where possible. Enforce via PR checklists.

- **Human Error in Configuration:**  
  Many configuration points can lead to misconfigurations. *Mitigation:* Provide sane defaults and example config files. Validate config in CI. Encourage testing in dev environments first.

- **Unseen Corner Cases:**  
  Data pipelines may encounter edge cases not covered by the example. *Mitigation:* Teams should extend tests for domain-specific cases. The template is flexible to handle scale and complexity as needed.

By acknowledging these risks and debt items in the architecture documentation, we ensure they are visible and can be managed. The template is a starting point—while it reduces initial setup time, ongoing maintenance and operational best practices are still required for long-term success.
